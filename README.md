# Equity Awards Carta (Take Home)

This project is solution to Carta's take home exercise, which was building a standalone frontend app to render information about equity awards.

I chose to use React as it's the framework I have the most proficiency with. Since I have never used Typescript profissionally before, I chose not to use it in this project, but I certainly would if there were not time constraints.

The project was created using a CLI called `create-react-app` in order to ease the set up and save some time.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
